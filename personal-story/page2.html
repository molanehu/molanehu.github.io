  When I missed China, they would try to cook some Chinese food for me. <br>I remembered that tey have made me sweet and sour chicken. <br>Even if it was actually "American-Chinese food", I appreciatd all the things they did for me. <br>They are such a kind counple. <br>They were like the candles which brought me light and warm. </p>
