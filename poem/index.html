  <p>The world has slept to the glory of nightÂ <br>Look it is such a pretty sightÂ <br>Night gives some kind of peace <br>Â Where you can just be and ceaseÂ <br>Night time lets you think aboutÂ <br>The pleasant day that is going to comeÂ <br>Reflect on things of the pastÂ <br>Dreams of times which are going to lastÂ <br>Night is indeed pretty and niceÂ <br>It lets you be yourself and wise<br>Give in to the warmth of nightÂ <br>Give in to this wonderful sightÂ <br>Wishing you a good nightÂ <br>Don't forget to sleep tight!
