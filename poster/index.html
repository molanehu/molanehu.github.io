  In terms of historical significance, Zhang's original painting of the Along the River During the Qingming Festival reveals <br> much about life in China during the 11th-12th century. Its myriad depictions of different people interacting with one another reveals<br>  the nuances of class structure and the many hardships of urban life as well. It also displays accurate depictions of technological <br>practices found in Song China. For example, it depicts one river ship lowering its bipod mast before passing under the prominent bridge of <br>the painting.It shows ships in two major types, yet all of which have slung rudders for steering; the painting depicts freighters with narrow <br>sterns or passenger boats and smaller craft with broad sterns, sailing upriver or docked along the banks while loading and unloading goods. <br>Large stern sweeps and bow sweeps can be seen on at least three of the river ships, worked by up to eight men each.It also shows how personal<br> gardens had begun to take root in China—in addition to the immense walled garden on the far left of the scroll, for example, one sees several<br> private gardens with their man-made mountains and rockery (for example, the small private garden close to the city gate, squeezed between a <br> chemist's shop and a large building selling furniture, consisting of a small pond surrounded by trees and bamboo).
