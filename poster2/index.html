      <div id = "b">Blue-And-White Porcelain<br><br>Blue and white pottery" <br>(Chinese: 青花; pinyin: qīng-huā; literally: "Blue flowers")<br> <br>covers a wide range of white pottery and porcelain decorated under the glaze with a blue pigment,generally cobalt oxide. The decoration is commonly applied by hand, originally by brush painting,but nowadays by stencilling or by transfer-printing, though other methods of application have also been used.<br><br> Blue and white decoration first became widely used in Chinese porcelain in the 14th century, after the cobalt pigment for the blue began to be imported from Persia. However, the origin of this decorative style is thought to lie in Iraq,<br><br>white pottery and added decorative motifs in blue glazes that had been developed by preexisting Mesopotamian cultures. Such Abbasid-era "blue and white" pieces have been found in present-day Iraq dating to the 9th century A.D. decades after the opening of a direct sea route from Iraq to China.Later, in China, a style of decoration based on sinuous plant forms spreading across the object was perfected and most commonly used.It was widely exported, and inspired imitative wares in Islamic ceramics and later European tin-glazed earthenware such as Delftware and after the techniques were discovered in the 18th century, European porcelain. Blue and white pottery in all of these traditions continues to be produced, most of it copying earlier styles. </div><br>
